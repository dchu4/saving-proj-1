    <p>Paramount of Oak Park is proud to offer a unique range of services for those residents with dementia.  Our staff is trained in the latest forms of therapy and care for the dementia patient, and we offer a warm, comfortable, and safe atmosphere.</p>

    <p>The daily routine and plan of care for the dementia patient will differ from individual to individual, but it begins with a thorough analysis and consultation with the residentâ€™s caregivers, family, and medical team.  We make sure to involve everyone with whom the resident is familiar and comfortable, so as to lessen any stress on him or her.</p>

    <p>At Paramount of Oak Park, we focus on our staff education, and therapeutic programming in order to implement a "habilitation" model of care. Habilitation focuses on maintaining the skills, interests and abilities the resident has, a proven successful model for treating the dementia resident.</p>

    <p>In addition, we encourage and welcome family and friends to visit, talk to our caregivers, and check in on the status of their loved one.</p>
